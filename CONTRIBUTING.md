## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We follow the **Git Flow** branching model ([Vincent Driessen, 2010](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)), adapted to use `main` instead of `master`.

#### Main Branches

These two branches exist permanently and should always be in a stable state:

| Branch    | Purpose                                                                       |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main`    | Production-ready code. Every merge into `main` represents a new release.      |
| `develop` | Integration branch containing the latest delivered changes for the next release. |

#### Supporting Branches

Supporting branches have a limited lifetime and are removed after merging.

| Branch      | Branches from | Merges back to       | Naming      | Purpose                                                  |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Feature** | `develop`     | `develop`            | `feature/*` | New features (e.g., `feature/add-rbm-integration`)       |
| **Bugfix**  | `develop`     | `develop`            | `bugfix/*`  | Non-urgent bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/fix-grid-parsing`)   |
| **Release** | `develop`     | `main` and `develop` | `release/*` | Prepare a release: version bumps, last-minute fixes      |
| **Hotfix**  | `main`        | `main` and `develop` | `hotfix/*`  | Urgent production fixes that can't wait for next release |

#### Merge Rules

- Use `--no-ff` (no fast-forward) when merging branches so that the branch history is preserved as a distinct group of commits:
  ```bash
  git merge --no-ff feature/my-new-feature
  ```
- Delete the supporting branch after it has been merged.

### Workflow Steps

1. **Create feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

2. **Make changes:**
   - Write code following style guidelines (see below)
   - Add comments and docstrings
   - Test locally

3. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description"
   ```

4. **Push to remote:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```

5. **Create Pull Request:**
   - Go to GitHub and create PR from your feature branch to `develop`
   - Fill out PR template with description of changes
   - Request review from maintainers

6. **Address review feedback:**
   - Make requested changes
   - Push updates to same branch
   - PR will update automatically

7. **Merge:**
   - Once approved, maintainer will merge to `develop` using `--no-ff`
   - When ready for a release, create a `release/*` branch from `develop` for final prep, then merge to `main` and back to `develop`
   - Hotfixes branch directly from `main` and merge back to both `main` and `develop`

---

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python (Backend)

**Follow PEP 8 with these specifics:**

#### Naming Conventions
```python
# Functions: lowercase with underscores
def fetch_wspr_spots(lastInterval=15):
    pass

# Variables: lowercase with underscores
spot_count = 0
rx_callsign = "KD3ALD"

# Constants: UPPERCASE with underscores
CONTEST_BANDS = ["160m", "80m", "40m", "20m", "15m", "10m"]

# Classes: PascalCase (if needed)
class SpotAggregator:
    pass
```

#### Docstrings
Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def frequency_to_band(freq):
    """
    Convert frequency in MHz to amateur radio band designation.

    Maps frequencies to standard amateur radio band names based on
    FCC frequency allocations.

    Args:
        freq (float): Frequency in MHz (e.g., 14.097 for 20 meters)

    Returns:
        str: Band designation (e.g., "20m") or "Unknown" if not in amateur band

    Example:
        >>> frequency_to_band(14.097)
        '20m'
    """
    if 14.0 <= freq < 14.35:
        return "20m"
    return "Unknown"
```

#### Comments
```python
# Good: Explain WHY, not WHAT
# Convert threshold to database format (stores as separate date/time strings)
threshold_date = f"{threshold.year % 100:02d}{threshold.month:02d}{threshold.day:02d}"

# Bad: States the obvious
# Set threshold_date variable
threshold_date = f"{threshold.year % 100:02d}{threshold.month:02d}{threshold.day:02d}"
```

#### Imports
```python
# Standard library imports first
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import json

# Third-party imports second
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Local imports last
from utils import helper_function
```

---

### JavaScript (Frontend)

**Follow Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide with modifications:**

#### Naming Conventions
```javascript
// Functions: camelCase
function loadSpots() {
    // ...
}

// Variables: camelCase
let spotCount = 0;
const rxCallsign = "KD3ALD";

// Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
const CONTEST_BANDS = ["160m", "80m", "40m", "20m", "15m", "10m"];

// Private functions: _prefixed (convention)
function _parseInternalFormat(data) {
    // ...
}
```

#### JSDoc Comments
```javascript
/**
 * Lookup country name from geographic coordinates.
 *
 * Uses Turf.js point-in-polygon test against country boundary polygons
 * to determine which country contains the given coordinates.
 *
 * @param {number} lat - Latitude in decimal degrees
 * @param {number} lon - Longitude in decimal degrees
 * @returns {string} Country name or "Unknown" if not found
 *
 * @example
 * lookupCountry(40.7128, -74.0060) // "United States of America"
 */
function lookupCountry(lat, lon) {
    const pt = turf.point([lon, lat]);
    for (const feature of countryFeat) {
        if (turf.booleanPointInPolygon(pt, feature)) {
            return feature.properties.name || "Unknown";
        }
    }
    return "Unknown";
}
```

#### Async/Await (Preferred over Promises)
```javascript
// Good: async/await
async function loadSpots() {
    try {
        const res = await fetch('/spots?lastInterval=15');
        const spots = await res.json();
        renderSpots(spots);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Failed to load spots:', err);
    }
}

// Avoid: Promise chains
function loadSpots() {
    fetch('/spots?lastInterval=15')
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(spots => renderSpots(spots))
        .catch(err => console.error(err));
}
```

#### Error Handling
```javascript
// Always use try-catch for async operations
async function loadCountryPolygons() {
    try {
        const res = await fetch("js/countries.geojson");
        const data = await res.json();
        countryFeat = data.features;
        console.log("Loaded", countryFeat.length, "country polygons");
    } catch (err) {
        console.error("Failed to load countries.geojson", err);
        // Optionally: show user-friendly error message
        alert("Failed to load country data. Map filtering may not work.");
    }
}
```

---

### HTML/CSS

#### HTML Style
```html
<!-- Use semantic HTML5 -->
<section id="spot-info" class="info-panel">
    <h3>Spot Information</h3>
    <p>Found 45 spots from Europe</p>
</section>

<!-- Use descriptive IDs and classes -->
<button id="updateButton" class="btn btn-primary">Update</button>

<!-- Keep inline styles to minimum -->
<!-- Prefer CSS classes over inline style="" -->
```

#### CSS Style
```css
/* Use courier monospace font (project standard) */
body {
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
}

/* Group related rules */
.spot-counter {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 10px;
    right: 10px;
    background: white;
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
}

/* Use comments to explain non-obvious styling */
/* Green highlight for active bands (threshold met) */
td.value {
    background-color: green;
    color: white;
}
```
